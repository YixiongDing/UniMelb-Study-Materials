## Chapter 1 - An Introduction to HISE
- Lecture 7 High Integrity Systems and Safety Case Studies
    - March 28, 2019 3:20pm-4:15pm

### Learning outcomes
1. Define the term “high-integrity system”
2. Define the different classes of high-integrity system

### What is HISE? How are these different from ordinary software systems?

1. "must work right the first time"
2. Ones in which failure has unacceptable consequences
    - loss of life
    - loss of money

### Safety Critical Systems
- Railway Signalling

### Finance Critical Systems
- High-Frequency Trading Software
- Stock Exchange
- Banking

### Mission Critical
- NASA

### Commercial Formal Methods - Altran galois
1. Crypto and Security Design / Building Blocks
2. Safety/Security Analysis
3. Design Modelling and Analysis (Alloy)
4. Ada
5. Proof (Hoare Logic) & Safe Languages (SPARK)
6. Fault Tolerant Design

## Chapter 2 — Ada
### Learning outcomes
1. Describe the features of Ada that make it suitable for high-integrity software
2. Read and modify basic Ada programs

## Chapter 3 — Safety engineering
- Lecture 7 High Integrity Systems and Safety Case Studies
    - March 28, 2019 3:20pm-4:15pm
- Lecture 8 Safety Engineering, HAZOP, Fault Tree Analysis Security Engineering: Threat Modelling  
    - March 29, 2019 1:05pm-2:00pm

### Learning outcomes
1. Explain the role of safety engineering in the system engineering lifecycle.
2. Discuss the role of accidents and incidents in the safety analysis process
3. Perform a preliminary hazard analsyis using the HAZOP method
4. Apply the fault-tree analysis method to a system for a given fault

### What is Safety
1. Doesn't cause unacceptable harm to the environment or people
    - How we define and quantify unacceptability is a big part of safety engineering
