### Question 1.2 (2 marks)
What is scope creep? Explain one way of dealing with it in the context of a waterfall project? Explain one way of dealing with it in the context of an agile project?

#### Answer
1. Scope creep:
    - in project management refers to changes, continuous or uncontrolled growth in a project’s scope, at any point after the project begins. This can occur when the scope of a project is not properly defined, documented, or controlled. It is generally considered harmful.

    - is when new requirements are added after the project has started. Often these changes are not properly reviewed. The project team is expected to deliver them with the same resources and in the same time as the original scope.

2. Waterfall:
    - To avoid the worst kinds of scope creep, a project manager should consider even minor adjustments to the original project scope carefully and rework time lines, provide new estimates and communicate with the stakeholders before integrating changes. This should filter out all but the most important concerns.

3. Agile:
    - When new changes are made by the stakeholders, the product owner should discuss the new changes and requirements with the whole scrum team and rearrange the user stories in the Product Backlog and Sprint Backlog during the Sprint Planning Meeting.

### Question 1.3 (2 marks)
Explain the three types of interviews described in the lectures. Then, give an example of a situation where each type could be appropriately used.

#### Answer
1. Structured interviews
    - This is also known as a formal interview (like a job interview).
    - The questions are asked in a set / standardized order and the interviewer will not deviate from the interview schedule or probe beyond the answers received (so they are not flexible).

    - Situation: Qualitative research, job interview

2. Unstructured interviews
    - An interview schedule might not be used, and even if one is used, they will contain open-ended questions that can be asked in any order. Some questions might be added / missed as the Interview progresses.

    - Situation: Jon interview, The employer may review your records beforehand, then ask questions related to your previous experience.

3. Semi-structured interviews
    - While a structured interview has a rigorous set of questions which does not allow one to divert, a semi-structured interview is open, allowing new ideas to be brought up during the interview as a result of what the interviewee says. The interviewer in a semi-structured interview generally has a framework of themes to be explored.
   
     - Situation: This method is used during both the early and late stages of exploring the research domain. Qualitative research.

In an agile development composed of 6 sprints, in what sprints would you conduct requirement analysis tasks? Why?

#### Answer
During all the 6 sprints.

Requirement analysis is one of the major activities in backlog grooming. The requirement analysis activity does not stop in the Sprint Planning Meeting, but continues during the actual Sprint. During the Sprint, test case design, modeling workshop, requirement discussion while designing and coding, and discovery from exploratory testing all contain some element of requirement analysis. Even in the Sprint Review, you will see requirement analysis activity through feedback and suggestion for improvement (new items).
